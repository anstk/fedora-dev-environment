Welcome
# Things to do after installing Fedora Linux

This wiki is based on [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/) Linux, currently at version 37

My personal development environment setup for Full Stack Development. Some programs not listed here, is already installed by default with Fedora and Gnome.

## Why did i create this simple wiki?
I created it for my personal reference. Fedora releases a new version every 6 months. With each release I created a personal wiki on my computer. By putting it on Github I can update, maintain history and view the wiki from any device.
